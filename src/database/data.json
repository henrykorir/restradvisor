They ask how your day was then lead you to a table for whatever meal of the day or to the bar for your drinks. Try their salmon and you will be hooked. The servers know the food well. They are well presented and serve with a smile always. Keep it up. Then there is breakfast too!! Well done Zahra and your team."
