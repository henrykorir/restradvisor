They had a lovely 2-man band in the garden and it made a pleasant ambience all around. Staff sang with much gusto at our table for my birthday It was quiet due to recent flooding, but I reckon the damages have now been resolved. Would definitely visit again. Thanx for having us Lord Erroll "

Just love the place and my Romanian friends got really found if Lord Erroll too highly recommend the experience if you are in Nairobi!"
